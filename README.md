We should propbably add any additional ideas that we have here. 


-Trent
Some of my thoughts: 
	User tracking for badge collection:
	Pack Leader tools for recording commendations, attendance, etc. 
		Would provide interesting metrics for analysis

-Vadim
Some of my thoughts:
	Trent is being very productive!

	Check out their website, we could replicate some of the features
	from the website.
